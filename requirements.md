# Expectations

- **Security:** The core focus of this task is on security. Ensure that you address common security vulnerabilities and follow best practices for both front-end and back-end development.
- **Code Quality:** Write clean, maintainable code following proper design patterns (e.g., MVC). Ensure proper separation of concerns between the front-end, back-end, and database.
- **Encryption:** Demonstrate proficiency in cryptographic techniques, including both encryption at rest and encryption in transit (e.g., TLS, AES).
- **Testing:** The application should be well-tested.

## Submission Guidelines

### GitHub Repository
- Submit the code via a GitHub repository with a clear and detailed `README.md`.
- The `README` should include step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run your application.
- Ensure that your project is fully Dockerized for ease of deployment.

### Running the Application
- We will use the following commands to evaluate and launch your application. Please verify that these steps work seamlessly:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd secure-file-share

# Start the application
docker-compose up --build
```

# Project Overview

## Task
Embark on an exciting challenge to develop a **secure file-sharing web application**!  
This application will enable users to upload, download, and share files with others, all while enforcing stringent security measures. Your mission is to demonstrate your full-stack development expertise and your deep understanding of cybersecurity best practices.

---

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication and Authorization
- Users can register, log in, and log out.
- Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** (e.g., using email, SMS, or a TOTP authenticator app like Google Authenticator).
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)**:
  - **Admin:** Can manage all users and files.
  - **Regular User:** Can upload, download, and share files.
  - **Guest:** Can only view shared files with limited access.

### 2. File Upload and Encryption
- Users can upload files to the system.
- Files should be **encrypted at rest** using a strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256).
- Allow users to download files and decrypt them securely on the client side.

### 3. File Sharing with Access Control
- Users can share files with specific other users, assigning them view or download permissions.
- Implement a **secure sharing mechanism** (e.g., generating a one-time shareable link with an expiration time).

### 4. Secure File Sharing
- Allow users to generate **secure shareable links** that automatically expire after a set time period.

# Technical Requirements

## Front-End
- **Framework:** Use **React 18 with TSX**, **NextJS**, **Tailwind CSS**, for the front-end.
- **State Management:** Use **Redux** for managing application state.
- **File Uploads:** Implement a file upload system with a secure file transfer interface.
- **Encryption:** Encrypt files client-side before uploading using a cryptography library (e.g., Web Crypto API).
- **Authentication:** Implement MFA during the login flow (e.g., via a secondary TOTP-based authentication step).
- **Secure File Sharing:** Allow users to generate secure shareable links that automatically expire after a set time period.

## Back-End
- **Framework:** Use **Python with Django** for the back-end.
- **Database:** Use **SQLite** for storing user, file, and permission data.
- **Encryption:** Implement **AES-256 encryption** for files at rest using a server-side key management system.
- **Authentication:** Implement **JWT-based authentication** with support for MFA.
- **Access Control:** Implement **RBAC** to enforce different levels of file access permissions.
- **API:** Build a RESTful API with the following endpoints:
  - User registration, login (with MFA), and logout.
  - File upload, download, and sharing with permission management.

# Security Requirements

- **SSL/TLS:** Ensure the back-end server is configured to only accept HTTPS traffic with valid certificates (you can use self-signed certificates for local development).
- **Password Security:** Hash passwords using a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before storing them in the database.
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize all input on both the client-side and server-side to prevent malicious data entry.
- **Session Management:** Ensure secure session handling (using JWTs with proper expiration, secure, and HttpOnly cookies).
